            <h5 class="titrearticle">Pre-Roman Iberia and the Roman Conquest (Before 1st Century)</h5>
            <p>The Iberian Peninsula, the region that would become Spain, was home to diverse cultures and civilizations long before the arrival of the Romans. Indigenous tribes such as the Iberians and the Celts inhabited the area, developing their own unique customs and societies. The Phoenicians, Greeks, and Carthaginians established trading colonies along the coast, contributing to the cultural and economic development of the region. The Roman conquest of Iberia began in the 3rd century BCE during the Punic Wars. Over the next two centuries, the Romans gradually subjugated the peninsula, culminating in the complete Romanization of Hispania, which became an integral part of the Roman Empire.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">Visigothic Rule and the Early Middle Ages (5th to 8th Century)</h5>
            <p>With the decline of the Roman Empire, the Visigoths, a Germanic tribe, established a kingdom in Iberia in the 5th century. The Visigothic Kingdom, with its capital at Toledo, played a significant role in the transition from Roman to medieval Iberia. The Visigoths adopted Catholic Christianity, fostering a cultural and religious continuity with the Roman past. Their rule was characterized by the blending of Roman and Germanic traditions, creating a distinct Visigothic identity. However, internal strife and external pressures weakened the kingdom, setting the stage for the Muslim invasion in the early 8th century.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Muslim Conquest and Al-Andalus (711 to 10th Century)</h5>
            <p>In 711, Muslim forces from North Africa, led by Tariq ibn Ziyad, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and swiftly conquered the Visigothic Kingdom. This marked the beginning of Al-Andalus, the Muslim-ruled territories in Iberia. Under the Umayyad Caliphate, Al-Andalus became a center of learning, culture, and economic prosperity. The city of Córdoba, in particular, flourished as a major intellectual and cultural hub. The coexistence of Muslims, Christians, and Jews, though not without tensions, led to significant cultural exchanges and advancements in science, medicine, philosophy, and the arts.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Rise of the Christian Kingdoms (8th to 10th Century)</h5>
            <p>The Muslim conquest was not complete, and resistance persisted in the northern mountainous regions. Christian kingdoms such as Asturias, León, Navarre, and Aragon emerged and began the long process of the Reconquista, the Christian effort to reclaim Iberian territories from Muslim rule. This period saw the gradual expansion of these kingdoms southward, marked by intermittent warfare, alliances, and territorial gains. The Battle of Covadonga in 722, considered a seminal event, symbolized the beginning of Christian resurgence under King Pelayo of Asturias.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Reconquista and the Formation of Castile and Aragon (10th to 13th Century)</h5>
            <p>The 10th to 13th centuries were crucial in the Reconquista. The Kingdom of León expanded significantly, while the County of Castile gained autonomy and eventually became a powerful kingdom. Aragon also emerged as a significant Christian kingdom, expanding both within Iberia and across the Mediterranean. The union of various Christian kingdoms through strategic marriages and alliances strengthened their efforts against the Muslim states. Key victories, such as the capture of Toledo in 1085 by Alfonso VI of Castile, marked significant milestones in the Reconquista, leading to the gradual decline of Muslim power in Iberia.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Almoravids and Almohads (11th to 13th Century)</h5>
            <p>In response to the advancing Christian forces, the Muslim rulers of Al-Andalus sought help from North African dynasties. The Almoravids (11th-12th century) and later the Almohads (12th-13th century) crossed into Iberia to bolster Muslim defenses. They initially achieved success, reversing some Christian gains and consolidating Muslim control. However, internal strife and military defeats, such as the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, weakened these dynasties. This pivotal battle, won by the combined Christian forces, marked the beginning of the end for Almohad power in Iberia, accelerating the Reconquista.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Unification of Castile and León (13th Century)</h5>
            <p>The Kingdoms of Castile and León, initially separate entities, underwent periods of union and separation through complex dynastic arrangements. The definitive union occurred in 1230 under Ferdinand III, who became the king of both Castile and León. This unification created a powerful Christian kingdom, significantly enhancing the military and political strength needed to continue the Reconquista. Ferdinand III's reign saw major territorial expansions, including the conquest of Córdoba and Seville, further diminishing Muslim territories in Iberia.</p>

            <p>The Crown of Aragon, formed by the union of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona in 1137, became a major power in the Mediterranean. Aragonese monarchs pursued a policy of expansion, conquering the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Sardinia, and parts of Greece. This expansion was driven by both commercial interests and the desire to spread Christianity. The Crown of Aragon developed a sophisticated maritime economy, fostering trade and cultural exchanges throughout the Mediterranean. The political structure of the Crown, characterized by a degree of autonomy for its constituent territories, facilitated its diverse and expansive nature.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Fall of Granada and the Completion of the Reconquista (1492)</h5>
            <p>The final phase of the Reconquista culminated in the conquest of Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in Iberia. The Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, launched a military campaign in 1482 that ultimately led to the surrender of Granada on January 2, 1492. The fall of Granada marked the end of Muslim rule in Iberia and the completion of the Reconquista. This event not only unified Spain under Christian rule but also paved the way for the emergence of Spain as a major European power. The conquest of Granada was celebrated as a significant triumph and had profound cultural and political implications for Spain.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Catholic Monarchs and the Age of Exploration (15th to 16th Century)</h5>
            <p>The reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, known as the Catholic Monarchs, marked the beginning of Spain's Golden Age. Their marriage in 1469 united the crowns of Castile and Aragon, creating a dynastic union that laid the foundation for the modern Spanish state. The Catholic Monarchs implemented significant administrative, legal, and religious reforms, including the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition in 1478. Their support for Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492 led to the discovery of the New World, initiating an era of Spanish exploration and colonization. Spain rapidly expanded its empire, establishing vast colonies in the Americas and becoming a leading global power.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Habsburg Dynasty and Imperial Spain (16th to 17th Century)</h5>
            <p>The marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella's daughter, Joanna, to Philip the Handsome of the Habsburg dynasty, brought Spain under Habsburg rule. Charles I (1516-1556), their grandson, inherited a vast empire that included Spain, the Low Countries, parts of Italy, and the Americas. As Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, he faced numerous challenges, including the Protestant Reformation and conflicts with France and the Ottoman Empire. His son, Philip II (1556-1598), continued the centralization of power and faced the Spanish Armada's defeat in 1588. The Habsburg era saw immense cultural flourishing, known as the Spanish Golden Age, but also economic difficulties and military overreach.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Decline of Habsburg Spain (17th Century)</h5>
            <p>The 17th century was a period of decline for Habsburg Spain. The empire faced continuous wars, economic troubles, and internal strife. The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) drained resources, and the Treaty of Westphalia marked a significant territorial loss. The reigns of Philip III (1598-1621) and Philip IV (1621-1665) were marked by ineffective governance and economic decline. The Catalan Revolt (1640-1652) and the Portuguese Restoration War (1640-1668) further weakened the empire. Despite these challenges, Spain remained a major European power, although its dominance was increasingly challenged by rising nations such as France and England.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The War of Spanish Succession and the Bourbon Reforms (18th Century)</h5>
            <p>The death of the childless Charles II in 1700 triggered the War of Spanish Succession (1701-1714), a major European conflict over who should succeed to the Spanish throne. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) ended the war, confirming Philip V, a Bourbon, as king but ceding significant territories to other European powers. The new Bourbon dynasty implemented a series of reforms to modernize Spain's administration, economy, and military. These Bourbon Reforms aimed to centralize authority, reduce corruption, and revitalize the Spanish economy. While these reforms had mixed success, they laid the groundwork for Spain's gradual recovery and modernization.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Enlightenment and Charles III’s Reforms (18th Century)</h5>
            <p>The reign of Charles III (1759-1788) marked a period of enlightened absolutism and reform in Spain. Influenced by Enlightenment ideas, Charles III sought to modernize Spain through administrative, economic, and social reforms. He improved infrastructure, encouraged agricultural innovation, and supported scientific research and education. Charles III’s policies aimed to reduce the influence of the nobility and the Church in favor of a more centralized and efficient state. While his reforms had varying degrees of success, they contributed to Spain's gradual modernization and laid the foundation for future developments.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Napoleonic Era and the Peninsular War (1808 to 1814)</h5>
            <p>The early 19th century brought significant upheaval to Spain. In 1808, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain and installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte as king, sparking widespread resistance. The Peninsular War (1808-1814) ensued, a brutal conflict involving Spanish, British, and Portuguese forces against the French. The war devastated Spain but ultimately led to the expulsion of French troops and the restoration of Ferdinand VII to the throne. The Peninsular War had profound consequences, weakening Spanish authority and inspiring independence movements in Spain's American colonies.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Liberal Revolution and Civil Wars (19th Century)</h5>
            <p>Following the Peninsular War, Spain faced a turbulent 19th century marked by political instability and civil wars. The liberal revolution of 1820 sought to establish a constitutional monarchy, but it faced strong opposition from conservative forces, leading to the First Carlist War (1833-1839). The conflict between liberal and conservative factions continued throughout the century, with periodic uprisings and the Second and Third Carlist Wars (1846-1849 and 1872-1876). The century also saw economic challenges and the loss of most of Spain’s colonial empire, culminating in the Spanish-American War of 1898, which resulted in the loss of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">The Restoration and the Road to the Spanish Civil War (Late 19th to Early 20th Century)</h5>
            <p>The Bourbon Restoration in 1874, which reinstated Alfonso XII, brought a period of relative stability and modernization. However, deep social, economic, and political issues persisted. The early 20th century saw increasing political polarization, with the rise of anarchist, socialist, and nationalist movements. The dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923-1930) failed to address these underlying issues, leading to his resignation and the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. The Republic faced immense challenges, including economic turmoil, political extremism, and social unrest, eventually leading to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.</p>

            <h5 class="titrearticle">Modern Spain: Transition, Democracy, and Contemporary Challenges (1975 to Present)</h5>
            <p>The death of Francisco Franco in 1975 marked the beginning of Spain's transition to democracy. King Juan Carlos I played a crucial role in overseeing this peaceful transition, leading to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy and democratic governance. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 enshrined democratic principles and regional autonomy. Spain joined the European Union in 1986, spurring economic growth and modernization. Contemporary Spain faces challenges such as economic crises, regional independence movements (notably in Catalonia), and social issues. Despite these challenges, Spain has remained a stable and democratic nation, actively participating in international affairs and cultural exchanges.</p>
