            <h5 class="titrearticle">NEW : We added a new page (it's a copy of the current buss://french.fr)</h5>
            <p>So I added the new page for the Great French History to this website (because I own the website). But now I have a problem : What I'll do for the buss://french.fr website ? I have some proposition but I don't really know what to do so this is the propositions :</p>
            <p>-an autobiography page ;</p>
            <p>-a page where all of this site is in french ;</p>
            <p>-an other thing (to specify).</p>
            <p>So you can send comments one the buss://french.fr GihHub (link below) to help me decide what I'll do with the site</p>
